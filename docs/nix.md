# Nix and Nixpkgs

[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) is a purely functional package manager and [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/) is a package collection containing more than 6,000 packages. Nix provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks of packages, which makes package management reliable and reproducible.

It is installed in the PTC cluster but needs more tests. Interested users can contact the system administrator to set up in their environment.
