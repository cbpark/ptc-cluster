# Nix and Nixpkgs

[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) is a purely functional package manager and [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/) is a package collection containing more than 6,000 packages. Nix provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks of packages, which makes package management reliable and reproducible. It provides a good development environment for Haskell, Python, and C/C++.

It is installed in the PTC cluster but needs more tests. Interested users can contact the system administrator to set up in their environment.
